# android-pentest

This repo is a example of configure a mobile environment to make pentest with BurpSuite and Android Studio Virtual Devices.

## Requirements

- First you will need to configure your BurpSuite proxy to listen to all interfaces on port 80.

- Second, you must export the certificate.der from BurpSuite and later rename it to burp.cer

- The next step is to access the directory where the burp.cer file is, remembering that it will also be the directory where the keys will be generated.
