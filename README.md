# Mobile Pentest Env Config

This repo is a example of configure a mobile environment to make pentest with BurpSuite and Android Studio Virtual Devices.

## Requirements

- First you will need to configure your BurpSuite proxy to listen to all interfaces on port <XXXX>.
- Second, you must export the certificate.der from BurpSuite.
- The next step is to access the directory where the certificate.der file is, remembering that it will also be the directory where the keys will be generated.

## Configure

First create a virtual device in Android Studio and start the virtual device.

- Set a "x" permission for root.sh

`chmod +x root.sh`

- Execute the root script with a your virtual android device running.

## Import Certificates

- The script will import the file into your emulated Android environment. You just need to enter the name of the AVD if you have more than one.
- Note that the script has a sleep mode to wait for the emulated device to reboot. You can adjust it as you see fit.
- The next step is check `cacert.cer` in android files (Needs use Root Certificate Manager.apk to view trusteds certs).

# This Configuration is only to make a Android Studio Virtual Device environment, if you need a phisical device env, you need a root + magisk + certs
